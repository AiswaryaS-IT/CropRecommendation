# Crop Recommendation System ðŸŒ¾

This project provides a machine learning-based solution to recommend the most suitable crops for a given set of environmental conditions. It utilizes the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to classify crops based on soil and climate parameters.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts suitable crops based on:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Potassium (K)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH Level
  - Rainfall
- Evaluates model performance using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - **Confusion Matrix**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing various environmental conditions and corresponding crop labels. The dataset is pre-processed and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
